  <h2 style="font-size:18px">About me</h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="font-size:16px">
    Hi! My name is Marin and I am currently a Post-doctoral researcher within the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/me/over/afdelingen/biomechanical-engineering" style="color:grey">BioMechanical</a> departement at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl" style="color:grey">TU Delft</a>.
    Prior to this I completed my PhD at the <a href="http://www.ngcm.soton.ac.uk/" style="color:grey">Center for Doctoral training in Next Generation Computational Modelling</a> (CTD-NGCM) at the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/" style="color:grey">University of Southampton</a>under the supervision of <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/g.d.weymouth/?cHash=a5cd372875e05348d1a0a4a8cb6e5f8f" style="color:grey">Professor Gabriel Weymouth</a> and <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5x5lr2/professor-georges-limbert" style="color:grey">Professor Georges Limbert</a>
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:16px">
    My academic background includes a Bachelor of Engineering (First Class) in Yacht and Powercraft Design, during which my dissertation received the (<a style="color:grey">2017 RINA â€“ BAE Systems Student Naval Architect Award - Final Year Project</a>). Following this, I pursued a Master of Science (First Class) in Computational Fluid Dynamics, where I focused on the numerical modeling of ship maneuvering using computational fluid dynamics.

  <h2 style="font-size:18px">Interests</h2>

  <p style="font-size:16px">
    My research interests span several fields of computational fluid mechanics, ranging from fluid-structure interaction and the associated complex mechanics, to classical turbulence problems. My current research focuses on modeling the interplay between flexible membranes and unsteady flow, where I am coupling a Finite-Volume Cartesian grid fluid solver and a Finite-Element solid mechanics solver. This has wide-ranging applications, including modeling of foliage, parachutes, sails, heart valves, and insect wings. In addition to computational fluid dynamics.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:16px">I am also interested in sailing yacht performance prediction, weather forecasting, numerical methods (as applied to the aforementioned problems), and non-linear systems/chaos theory.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:16px">
    Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy engaging in my favorite activities such as sailing, kitesurfing, and hiking.
