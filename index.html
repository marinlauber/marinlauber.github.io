  <h2 style="font-size:18px">About me</h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="font-size:16px">
    Hi! I am a PhD student within the <a href="http://www.ngcm.soton.ac.uk/" style="color:grey">Center for Doctoral training in Next Generation Computational Modelling</a> (CTD-NGCM) at the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/" style="color:grey">University of Southampton</a>. I am part of the Maritime Engineering Group and I am based in the Bolderwood campus. I am a first year PhD student with <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/about/staff/gdw1d12.page" style="color:grey">Associate Professor Gabriel Weymouth</a> and <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/about/staff/gl1w07.page" style="color:grey">Associate Professor Georges Limbert</a> as my supervisory team.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:16px">
    I earned a Bachelor of Engineering (First Class) in Yacht and Powercraft Design where my dissertation was awarded the (<a style="color:grey">2017 RINA – BAE Systems Student Naval Architect Award - Final Year Project</a>). I then pursued a Master of Science (First Class) in Computationnal Fluid Dynamics where I focused on the Numerical modelling of ship manoeuvring using Computational Fluid Dynamics.

  <p style="font-size:16px">
    I’m interested in various different field of Computational fluid mechanics, from fluid-structure interaction and the complex mechanics involved to classical turbulence problem. My research is focus of modelling the interplay between flexible membranes and an unsteady flow, for this I am coupling a Finite-Volume Cartesian grid fluid solver and a Finite-Element solid mechanic solver. These has application in a wide range of flieds, from modelling of foliage, parachutes, sails, heart valves and insect wings. Outside of Computationnal fluid dynamics, I have intersts in sailing yacht performance prediction, weather forecasting, nunerical methods (applied to the aforemmentionned problems) and a bit a non-linear systems/chaos theory.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:16px">
    When I am not doing one of the above, I can usually be found doing some of my favorite activities i.e sailing, kitesurfing or cycling.
