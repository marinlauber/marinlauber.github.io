<h3>Abstract :</h3>

<p>
Immersed boundary methods are extensively used for fluid-structure interaction problems involving large deformations and complex motion of the body. When the driving force of the flow is the body itself, correctly capturing the pressure forces is extremely important, however, very few immersed boundary methods correctly impose the no-penetration condition which can lead to substantial errors in those forces. 
</p>

<p>
We show by means of numerical simulation of a 3D flapping wings that the correct pressure flux treatment on the immersed boundary must be applied in order to satisfy the no-slip/no-penetration boundary condition on thin immersed bodies.
